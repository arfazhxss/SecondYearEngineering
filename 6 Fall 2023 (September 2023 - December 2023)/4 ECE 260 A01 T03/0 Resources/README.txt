2020-05 ECE 260 Lecture Videos and Slide Deck
=============================================

This README document is part of the information package for the lecture
videos and slide deck for the course ECE 260 titled "Continuous-Time
Signals and Systems", which was taught in the Department of Electrical
and Computer Engineering at the University of Victoria (Canada) in the
2020-05 term.

Version
=======

The version of the information package can be found in the file called
"VERSION.txt".

Slide Deck
==========

The specific edition of the slide deck used for the lectures in the
course is as follows:

    Lecture Slides for Signals and Systems
    Edition 2020-05-ECE260
    Michael D. Adams

This edition of the slide deck is provided as a single PDF document in
the file called lecture_slides.pdf.  This edition of the slide deck
should be a very close match to the slides used in video lectures.
Some small differences exist, however, due to changes made to the slide
deck subsequent to the recording of the lecture content.

Lecture Videos
==============

All of the lecture content for the course is available online in video
format via YouTube.  The videos of the lectures can be found in the
YouTube playlist:

    https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbHYdvrWBMxYGMvQ3QG6paNu7CuIRL5dX

A fully-cataloged list of the slides covered in the lectures is also available.
Each slide in the list has a link to the corresponding time offset in the
YouTube video where the slide is covered.  This list is provided in both
PDF and HTML formats in the files:

    video_lectures.pdf

    video_lectures.html

Lecture Examples
================

All of the annotated examples presented in the video lectures are included
in this information package.  These examples are provided in two forms:

    1) as individual PDF documents (i.e., one document per example)
    in the directory called slides_supplemental; and

    2) as a single PDF document containing all examples in the
    file called lecture_examples.pdf.

The second form is likely more convenient for making a hardcopy of all
of the lecture examples, while the first form facilitates hyperlinking
from the slide deck document to individual lecture examples.

Supplemental Documents
======================

The directory called slides_supplemental contains numerous supplemental
PDF documents that are referenced via links by various slides in the
slide deck.  In order for these links to work correctly, the organization
and naming of the files/directories in this package MUST NOT BE CHANGED.
